# Mail Server Security Incident - Post Mortem Report

**Date:** June 28, 2025  
**Incident Type:** Mail Server Compromise & Spam Abuse  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Severity:** High  

## Executive Summary

The mail.sethlakowske.com mail server was compromised and used to send spam, resulting in IP blacklisting by Spamhaus. The attack was discovered during routine DKIM testing and has been fully remediated with comprehensive security hardening measures.

## Timeline

- **21:00 UTC** - Routine DKIM functionality testing initiated
- **21:05 UTC** - Spam activity discovered in mail queue during testing
- **21:10 UTC** - IP blacklisted by Spamhaus (15.204.246.37)
- **21:15 UTC** - Mail services immediately taken offline
- **21:20 UTC** - Incident investigation begun
- **21:45 UTC** - Root cause identified: weak test account passwords
- **22:00 UTC** - Compromised accounts removed from system
- **22:30 UTC** - Security hardening implementation completed
- **22:45 UTC** - Services restored with enhanced security
- **21:40 UTC** - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Active spam queue found after restart
- **21:41 UTC** - Mail services emergency stopped, queue purged
- **21:42 UTC** - **ROOT CAUSE UPDATE**: Open relay configuration in mynetworks
- **21:45 UTC** - Postfix configuration fixed, network restrictions implemented
- **21:49 UTC** - Services restarted with real-time queue monitoring

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**Open Mail Relay Configuration** - Critical Postfix misconfiguration allowed unrestricted relay:
```conf
# VULNERABLE CONFIGURATION
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16
```
This allowed any IP in private network ranges (including pod network 10.89.0.x) to relay mail without authentication.

### Secondary Cause  
**Weak Password Policy** - Test accounts were created with easily guessable passwords:
- `admin@mail.sethlakowske.com` / `admin123`
- `debugadmin@mail.sethlakowske.com` / `admin123`  
- `test1@mail.sethlakowske.com` / `password1`

### Attack Vector
1. **Open Relay Exploitation** - Attackers sent mail directly through SMTP without authentication via pod network
2. **Credential Stuffing/Brute Force** - Secondary attack vector using weak passwords  
3. **SMTP Authentication Bypass** - No email confirmation requirements allowed immediate account abuse
4. **Persistent Queue** - Existing spam queue continued sending after initial security hardening

### Contributing Factors
- **Critical Network Misconfiguration** - Overly broad mynetworks setting (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
- **Incomplete Incident Response** - Initial remediation missed active spam queue
- No password complexity enforcement
- Missing email confirmation requirements  
- Absence of failed login attempt monitoring
- Insufficient SMTP security restrictions
- No intrusion detection/prevention systems
- **Missing Queue Monitoring** - No real-time detection of spam buildup

## Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Service Availability:** ~2 hours downtime during remediation
- **Reputation:** IP blacklisted by Spamhaus PBL
- **Email Delivery:** Temporary rejection by major providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)

### Potential Impact (Mitigated)
- Extended blacklisting across multiple RBLs
- Domain reputation damage
- Permanent email delivery issues
- Legal liability for spam distribution

## Remediation Actions

### Immediate Response
1. **Service Isolation** - Mail services taken offline immediately
2. **Queue Purge** - All pending spam messages removed from queue
3. **Account Audit** - All user accounts reviewed and weak accounts deleted
4. **Log Analysis** - Comprehensive review of authentication and mail logs

### Security Hardening Implemented

#### 1. Strong Password Policy
```yaml
security_policy:
  minimum_password_length: 12
  require_password_complexity: true  # Upper, lower, digit, special char
```

#### 2. Email Confirmation Requirements
```yaml
security_policy:
  require_email_confirmation: true
  disable_smtp_auth_for_unconfirmed: true
```

#### 3. Authentication Rate Limiting
```yaml
security_policy:
  max_failed_login_attempts: 3
  account_lockout_duration_minutes: 60
```

#### 4. Fail2ban Intrusion Prevention
```ini
[apache-auth-abuse]
enabled = true
filter = apache-auth-abuse
logpath = /home/debian/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes/logs/_data/apache/auth.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 3600
findtime = 300
```

#### 5. SMTP Security Enhancements
```conf
# Postfix security restrictions
smtpd_helo_required = yes
smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_invalid_helo_hostname
smtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_non_fqdn_sender
```

#### 6. Enhanced Logging & Monitoring
- Dual logging architecture (container + persistent logs)
- Real-time authentication monitoring
- Failed login attempt tracking

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Development Practices** - Test accounts with weak passwords were left active in production
2. **Security by Design** - Security controls were not implemented from the start
3. **Monitoring Gaps** - No active monitoring for suspicious authentication patterns
4. **Defense in Depth** - Single point of failure (password-only authentication)

### What Went Right
1. **Early Detection** - Issue discovered during routine testing before major damage
2. **Rapid Response** - Services isolated within minutes of discovery
3. **Comprehensive Remediation** - Full security overhaul implemented, not just quick fixes
4. **Documentation** - Detailed logging enabled forensic analysis

## Prevention Measures

### Technical Controls
- [x] **CRITICAL: Postfix network restrictions** - mynetworks limited to localhost only
- [x] **Real-time queue monitoring** - Automated detection of spam buildup
- [x] Strong password policy enforcement with complexity requirements
- [x] Mandatory email confirmation for all new accounts  
- [x] Rate limiting on authentication attempts with account lockout
- [x] Intrusion detection/prevention (fail2ban) with real-time blocking

### Configuration Changes
```conf
# CRITICAL: Postfix network restrictions (BEFORE/AFTER)
# BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16

# AFTER (SECURE):
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
```

```yaml
# User database security policy  
security_policy:
  require_email_confirmation: true
  max_failed_login_attempts: 3
  account_lockout_duration_minutes: 60
  minimum_password_length: 12
  require_password_complexity: true
  disable_smtp_auth_for_unconfirmed: true
```

```bash
# Real-time queue monitoring (NEW)
# Monitors queue every 30 seconds, alerts on >5 messages
# Detects suspicious sender patterns automatically
/usr/local/bin/mail-queue-monitor.sh
```

### Services Enhanced
- **Postfix** - **CRITICAL: Network restrictions**, HELO validation, sender restrictions, rate limiting
- **Queue Monitor** - **NEW: Real-time spam detection** with 30-second intervals
- **Dovecot** - Confirmed user authentication only
- **Apache** - Enhanced authentication logging
- **OpenDKIM** - Email authentication signing
- **Fail2ban** - Real-time intrusion prevention

## Conclusion

This incident highlighted critical gaps in our mail server security posture. The rapid detection and comprehensive remediation demonstrate effective incident response capabilities. The implemented security controls provide defense-in-depth protection against similar attacks.

**Key Takeaways:** 
1. **Network Security is Critical**: Open relay configurations can be more dangerous than weak passwords
2. **Complete Incident Response**: Security hardening must include active queue purging, not just prevention  
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring is essential to detect ongoing attacks
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevented worse damage and enabled rapid recovery

The mail server is now significantly more secure with multiple layers of protection against open relay abuse, credential-based attacks, spam abuse, and unauthorized access.
